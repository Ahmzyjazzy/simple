# Simple

The Simple Intelligent and Modular Programming Language and Environment

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The simple programming language has it's backbone on the c programming language.
Although having a fair knowledge of the c language (or any programing language) will help you grasp simple in a relatively short time, you are not expected to have any programming exprience of any sort to be able to use SIMPLE.
You can simply read up the `getting started` examples from the documentation section and get up and running within minutes.

What things you need to use the language

```
GIT CLIENT
```

### Installing

A series of step by step examples to get you up to speed

```

## Deployment

Create your files with .sim as extension
Compile with `simple.exe -go filename.sim`
Run with `simple.exe filename.sim`
Note: filename is the name of your simple file
